The `make-spreadsheets.py` script was originally used during
the April-May timeframe for the first set of ECC COVID
wellness checks.

The spreadsheet was specifically designed to be edited online --
it's very, very wide.

Later, the parish did a 2nd round of COVID checks, in the
November-December timeframe.

The spreadsheet was re-designed to be much narrower, so that it
would be friendly to printing out in landscape mode.  That's
what's in the `make-spreadsheets-narrow.py` script.
