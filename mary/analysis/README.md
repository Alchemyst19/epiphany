Need to fill out more here.

The gist of this directory is that it is a bunch of analysis run on
PDS data.  The script is run manually.  Look at the code to know
precisely what it does: it's a bunch of analysis and data crunching
decided upon by Jeff Squyres, Mary Downs, and several Financial
Advisory Council members in the spring of 2021.

The script simply emits text output -- it does not emit a CSV or XLSX.

The data from the text output was manually entered into an Excel
spreadsheet, and then Excel's graphing functions were used to make
pretty graphs (Excel's graphinc functionality is just better than
Google Sheets).  After that, the XSLX was uploaded to Google Drive and
converted to a Google Sheet, where the pretty graphs were (mostly)
retained, and therefore able to be used in a Google Slides file.
